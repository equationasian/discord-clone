# Discord Clone
## Overview
A simplified clone of Discord that is still a work in progress. Users can create their own chatrooms and send invitations to other users. Chatrooms are split into two categories: rooms with only one other member are displayed under "Direct Messages" and all others are shown under "Group Chats". Servers are one large chatroom rather than being split into multiple channels and topics.
## Description
The server is pre-loaded with 3 users for quick testing, or you can choose to register your own account. Usernames / passwords are case-sensitive:
- Latte / lattepassword
- Mocha / mochapassword
- Domino / dominopassword

On successful login, users are redirected to the main chat page where all existing chatrooms are displayed on the left, or a new chatroom can be created.

Members of a chatroom are added by username. As the user begins typing, a dropdown menu will appear with all users matching the username. If only one member is added, the chatroom will be displayed under "Direct Messages".
